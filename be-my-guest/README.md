# Stats preview card component

![Design preview for the Stats preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.  You don't need to spend more than a few hours on this but feel free to spend as much time as you'd like.

You can use any tools, frameworks, libraries you like to help you complete the challenge. Bonus points though if you use the tech stack similar to Numikos e.g. Tailwind CSS

**Your users should be able to:**

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

**Things that we will be looking at for this challenge are:**

- Correct Semantic HTML markup.
- Clean, well structured code
- Smart use of CSS features
- Your eye for detail and ability to closely match designs
- How flexible your component is to changes in content and screen size

**As an extra we would also like you to take this component and enhance it with some JavaScript.  This could be some additional animation, or extra functionaility, anything.  We will leave this up to your imagination.**


## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.


## Deploying your project

You can submit this to Github/Bitbucket along with any build steps or complete the task in a [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or at [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)


**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
